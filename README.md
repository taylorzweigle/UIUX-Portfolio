## Tab Notebook

Conceptual mockups for a web app that allows for easy creation of sheet music for a song. Home page renders a table of all songs. Viewing a song will show the guitar (Lead or Rhythm) and its respective sheet music for each song section (Intro, Verse, Chorus, Bridge, Solo, Outro). Clicking on a song section will allow for the viewing and editing of the music for that portion of the song. Additional ability of the app allows for the collection of recommended guitar effects pedals and which ones should be used on which song section.
