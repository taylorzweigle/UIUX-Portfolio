# UI/UX Portfolio

Portfolio demonstration of personal UI/UX designs.

## Tab Notebook

Conceptual mockups for a web app that allows for easy creation of sheet music for a song. Home page renders a table of all songs. Viewing a song will show the guitar (Lead or Rhythm) and its respective sheet music for each song section (Intro, Verse, Chorus, Bridge, Solo, Outro). Clicking on a song section will allow for the viewing and editing of the music for that portion of the song. Additional ability of the app allows for the collection of recommended guitar effects pedals and which ones should be used on which song section.

## Play Tracker

Conceptual mockups for a desktop app that allows for easy creation of a game to track a team's air raid play calls. The home page renders a table of all games for a specified season. Viewing a game will show a table of plays, organized by play number, down and distance, formation, play call, position targeted, and if the play resulted in a first down, touchdown, or interception. Above the table is a form for easy creation of a play asking for the aforementioned details. Below the table are graphs showing the formation and play call distribution for the selected game. Additionally on the home screen, the same graphical breakdowns will be displayed for that season's games. The ability to preview a play based on formation is also available on the home screen.
