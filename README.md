# UI/UX Portfolio

Portfolio demonstration of personal UI/UX designs.

## Photo Map

Conceptual mockups for an iOS app that keeps track of photos taken at various locations around San Diego. The home page renders a map with pins of locations where photos were taken. Clicking on a pin shows the location name, description of landmarks at that location, how many times visited, total number of saved photos, and the ability to view photos. There is an alternate carousel view with the same functionality as the map. Viewing a location shows a flat list of photo thumbnails with the ability to view a photo full screen. The app also allows for the uploading and deletion of photos on a selected location.

## Play Tracker

Conceptual mockups for both a desktop and mobile app that allows for easy creation of a game to track a team's air raid play calls. The home page renders a table of all games for a specified season. Viewing a game will show a table of plays, organized by play number, down and distance, formation, play call, position targeted, and if the play resulted in a first down, touchdown, or interception. Above the table is a form for easy creation of a play asking for the aforementioned details. Below the table are graphs showing the formation and play call distribution for the selected game. Additionally, on the home screen, the same graphical breakdowns will be displayed for that season's games. The ability to preview a play based on formation is also available on the home screen.

## Restaurant Time Tracker

Conceptual mockups for both a desktop and mobile app that allows for the easy viewing of shift hours at a restaurant. The home screen renders a weekly view of assigned shift hours and the user has the ability to switch to a monthly view to see the same breakdown of shift assignments. Additionally, the user can click the button at the bottom of the screen to quickly log their hours for when they clocked in and when they clocked out.

## Tab Notebook

Conceptual mockups for a web app that allows for easy creation of sheet music for a song. Home page renders a table of all songs. Viewing a song will show the guitar (Lead or Rhythm) and its respective sheet music for each song section (Intro, Verse, Chorus, Bridge, Solo, Outro). Clicking on a song section will allow for the viewing and editing of the music for that portion of the song. Additional ability of the app allows for the collection of recommended guitar effects pedals and which ones should be used on which song section.
